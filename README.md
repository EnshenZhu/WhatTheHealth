# WhatTheHealth


## User Story
Walk in clinics are rarely a source of consistent care for patients. Doctors can be overwhelmed with too many patients, each having varying concerns. As a user I want to be able to have access to all my medical information in one location. Whether it be prescriptions, past and future apointments and even access to my doctor( in person or via video online)



## Goal Of Project
The goal of our app is to have a common ground where:

 - patients can see their current prescriptions, appointments and make adjustments to their profile if need be
 - doctors can access up to the minute patient data, write new prescriptions, and even meet with their patients via video
